**WIP**

### Local Setup

This repo is divided into two parts: `frontend` and `backend`.

Begin by setting up the backend:

```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then the frontend:

```
cd frontend
bower install
```

You must also have a `config.json` file somewhere in `frontend/`.

```
{
    "API_URL": "http://localhost:5000", // the URL for the backend API
    "CLIENT_ID": ..... //groupme app client ID
}
```

(Note that after updating your config.json, you may need to do a `gulp config` to update the config/config.js)

### Running Locally

Backend:

```
cd backend
python app.py
```

Frontend:

```
cd frontend
node index.js
```

Go to `localhost:3000`! 

### Tests

API tests are powered by py.test.

```
cd backend
pytest tests
```
